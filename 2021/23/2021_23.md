# Day 12: Passage Pathing.

### Task 1.

It is a backtracking with some additions. The addition is to create a map that stores does this vertex need to be marked as withited.

- Read data.
- Check how read.
- Create adjacency list and do_check_list.
- Start backtracking fill the valid paths array.
- Print valid paths array and it's size.

Let's try. 


### Task 2.

Instead of two maps check_visited and visited need to use limit and number_of_visits. For big caves number the limit would be set to -1 and they are always visited.
For small caves with only one element in the adjacency list limit vould be 2, for other limit would be 1. When enter backtracking increase nuber_of_visits, when exit decrease (but only for small caves).

Ok, I got it. Need to have a loop over all singe caves, and for each sigle cave set limit 2. Keep on working.

- Save limits into separate variable.
- Create listt of small caves exept start and end.
- Use set to store pathes.
