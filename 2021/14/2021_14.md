# Day 14: Extended Polymerization.

Solution based on the Hash that stores two characters keys and one character value. Also, a **sliding window** that starts at the `0` and ends at the `n-2` inclusively. During the sliding window loop into a new `polymer` copied the first character and a new `insertion`. At the end of the sliding window loop the last element of an `input polymer` is pushed into the `new polymer`.
