# Day 11: Dumbo Octopus.

### Task 1.

Iterate over the matrix, increase each element, it it's value greater then 9, increase all around by one.   
Iterate over the matirx and replase all lement that greater then 9 by zero increase a counter.

I got it, need to use BFS when flash happens.


- First increase all field by one. And create flashed matrix.
- Than create flash using BFS, marking used.
- Then count number of used flashes.

### Task 2.

Need to calculate when all cells flash. It could be implemented by counting number of flashed on each bfs. If number equal to area it is the case.
