# Day 13: Transparent Origami.

The idea for the first part is to create a new field on every fold. Iterate over all cells and calculate the value of a cell on the new board by logical `OR`. The boards would contain `true/false` boolean values.

There are four types of folds.

- Horizontal fold. Top >= Bottom.
- Horizontal fold. Top < Bottom.
- Vertical fold. Left >= Right.
- Vertical fold. Left < Right.

Need to calculate.

1. Type of a fold.
2. Size of the new board.
3. Areas where dots are copied from. When two parts of the sheet covering together dot copied from both parts.
