# Day 6: Lanternfish.

## Task one.

Using loop and a stack. Decrease counter, push new element when needed and rest to intial value.

Because pushing implements in a loop, need to push `9` for a new fish, because when loop reached this fish it going to ddecease the value `9` to `8` till the end of the day. And a new fish appears at the day `-1` that going to be transformed to a `6th` day.

## Task two.

Because of huge numbers now imposible to iterate over all fishes. Need to iterate over group of fished sorted by a `day state`. There are `9` type of states from `0` till `8`.

At the end of the day each fish from the states from `1` to `8` goes to lowers tats.
Only fishes from state 0 migrates to `6` and add same amount to the day `8`.

Need to have two arrays: `current_day` and `add_day`. On daily iterate decrease `current_day` in a loop, add values to `add_day` and then sum `current_day` and a `add_day`. Let's try.


Ruby code:

# = = = = = = =
# Accepted.
# Thanks God!

        if i.between?(1,8)
          add_day[i-1] += current_day[i]
        else
          add_day[6] += current_day[i]
          add_day[8] += current_day[i]
        end
      end
      l "#{add_day} - must be shifted."
      current_day = add_day
      l "After #{day.to_s.rjust(2," ")}: (#{current_day.sum}) #{current_day.join(?,)}"
      l "End #{day}--------------------"
